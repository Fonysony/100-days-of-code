# #100DaysOfCode Log

Today is Saturday, July 23, 2022 @ 11:28 24hrs.

I've decided today that I'm ready to take on this huge challenge! I finally was able to pick myself up mentally after all the burn-out I had with coding.

## My Personal Goals:

> - Stay consistent with coding.
> - Make projects on my own from scratch to show to employers.
> - Learn Data Structures and algorithms.
> - Able to do medium level coding problems.

### Day 1:

Saturday, July 23, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on this Leetcode problem, but couldn't it solve at the time. [Can-place-flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)
- Worked with a friend on [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) [Insurance](https://www.codechef.com/JULY222D/problems/INSURANCE) problem. Was able to solve this one in C++.
- Went over the [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) with a friend and actually started to understand inserting arrays when we attempted to do the algorithm by hand.
- Attempted to use a [zipcodes](https://github.com/davglass/zipcodes) GitHub repo to implement a zipcode search, but I struggling to get TypeScript to work. I never knew how much harder TypeScript could be until this day üòÖ.

**What I Learned:**

- If I'm gonna be doing this for 100 days, I need to keep everything simple and at least just to put 1 hour a day even if I lose sleep üò¢!! Can't let one day miss or it's game over üëæ!

### Day 2:

Sunday, July 24, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Learned some C++ with a buddy on an amazing website called [replit](https://replit.com/) to code along together!
- Moved all my photos out of my mid 2012 13inch Macbook Pro to a hard-drive. I looked into Arch Linux some more and wanted to download on my Macbook Pro.
- Spent 4 hours on this [coursehero](https://www.coursehero.com/register/) website where I saved the page as a complete webpage so, I could actually see all the code. I had delete so many files and format so many files. A lot of the files are minified so, I had to figure-out what they did, by moving them in a trash folder and seeing what happened. I got it all cleaned up though and it was worth it! I hope to check it out and see what I can learn from it.

**What I Learned:**

- Working with people can really help inspire to do more thing, but also waste some time if you're not careful. Just don't keep talking all day long and not do anything.
- I can actually download the code and clean it up just to see how a website works! I hope to soon rewrite the whole code my own way so, that I know I truly understand it.

### Day 3:

Monday, July 25, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Was help a friend with solving a Leetcode problem that I already was doing. [duplicate zeros](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3245/)
- Worked on the course hero html and css and I tried to learn from their code.
- Talked to and invited a bunch more people to this coding group I'm in.
- **What I Learned:**

- I gotta be more satisfied with what I'm doing. I feel overwhelmed with all that I'm doing and don't let myself feel accomplished when finish things.
- Gotta attempt to stay more organized and simpler so, things can run more smoothly so, I don't get so burn-out as much.

### Day 4:

Tueday, July 26, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on the [course hero login page](https://www.coursehero.com/login/?ref=login) with a friend side by side, but also chatted a bunch about goals and life.
- Listened to the [Develop Yourself](https://open.spotify.com/show/69BHCbRAl6rHT9LlNhFWUy) podcast by Aaron Hayslip & Peter Elbaum. Always cool to hear what other developers have to say.
- I worked on my Arch Linux install on my Macbook Pro and easily got the wifi driver installed so, I could use wifi on it. Took me ages to figure it out before, but because I did it before it was so much easier to do it now.

**What I Learned:**

- I seriously gotta get my goals in check and manage my tasks better. I got really burn-out today from thinking so much and it's not getting me anywhere.
- Some great resources that I want to follow is [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=asc_df_0735211299/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312014159412&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=788027916322023639&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019691&hvtargid=pla-541463258824&psc=1) by James Clear and [Eat That Frog!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6macBFlMWbmpFo4TmtR3MD) by Brian Tracy. These books have so much techniques, insight on finding bad habits, and best ways to optimize yourself to best fit your needs.

### Day 5:

Wednesday, July 27, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- RE-listened to [Eat That Frog!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6macBFlMWbmpFo4TmtR3MD) and actually applied what I learned from it! I did [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) for my very first frog. I choose to do the bootcamp first because I deemed it as the most important task for me to do, my most important frog to eat.
- I did a couple sections on [Khan Academy's divide with remainder](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/x18ca194a:divide-with-remainders) section. I got suck on some of the word problems due to not understanding the problem well or couldn't wrap my head around fractions and division. I'm a little sad, but it will come with practice, I just gotta review it again.
- I attempted to do the [Duplicate number in array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) Leetcode problem, I actually couldn't understand how to process with the problem, but once I checked the related topics section and realized it was part of the sorting problems, I figured out how to solve it. Still sad that I'm struggling with these problems, but I solved it so, who cares.

**What I Learned:**

- Organizing my environment ahead of time will help me be more productive and planning out my week will help with staying on track.
- Finishing my most important task first will really help me stay on task at the start, then I'm more able to procrastinate on my little task cause it's inevitable.

### Day 6:

Thursday, July 28, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- I showed one of my new friends my course-hero clone that I'm doing and let him show me his methods of doing the css. We talked for a while and now I feel more confident with my css skills. The code doesn't have to be perfect, if it works it works.
- Listened to a book about power and deception.

**What I Learned:**

- If you talk to much, you have more of the odds of saying something foolish than saying less.
- If you keep things vague, people might think of you as smarter and attempting to understand what exactly do you mean.

### Day 7:

Friday, July 29, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) and feel pretty good about routes. Just gotta keep hacking away at it.
- Got bluetooth working with Arch Linux using the bluez and bluetoothctl package.

**What I Learned:**

- Somedays you won't get much done, but it's better to do something than nothing.
- I'm exicted and motivated to get better at css! I can't wait to make thing and make it look good. After that, I can work on my backend and DOM skills.

### Day 8:

Saturday, July 30, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) with a friend on Discord and struggled through it, but after 40 minutes of doing it my way, I got it to work with the help of the friend.
- Later work on some C++ with another friend, just going over the basics.

**What I Learned:**

- Today I had the whole day to do my things and most of it was wasted. I Gotta seriously make sure that I get my big tasks run right away before starting anything else so, I at least have my things done and can slack off then.
- Somedays will be like this, but I must not get discourged.

### Day 9:

Sunday, July 31, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Messed with Arch Linux a ton, I got a background, transparent terminals, and learning more about Vim. I did some of the Vim's tutorial and watched videos on how to add plugins into NeoVim.

**What I Learned:**

- I'm getting very distracted from doing actual code. I've been watching anime again and read manga which is taking a lot of my time. It's really hard to fight the urge right now even.
- I can no get discourged and keep moving towards my goals.

### Day 10:

Monday, August 1, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on the [404 Not Found](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) page on the [dev challenges](https://devchallenges.io/) website where you can choose a guided path to learn from. Their front-end projects so, far look cool so, I decided to try it out with a friend. I didn't finish it yet, but I will finish in this week.

**What I Learned:**

- Sometimes you will have bad days, bad weeks or bad years, but you can't let that stop you from making a change. Lately I feel like I haven't done enough then I should have, but that's the past and all that matters what I can accomplish today.
- All I can say is, don't get addicated to anime cause it's gonna hurt üò¢.

### Day 11:

Tuesday, August 2, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Followed along with [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), just messed with some ejs-mate and some Bootstrap.
- I finally only need to finish the unit test on [Khan Academy's Divide with remainders](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/x18ca194a:divide-with-remainders) section! I'm almost half way to finishing Arithmetic on Khan Academy!
- Attempted to do the [group-anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) problem on Leetcode for 25 minutes and because I have already learned from the pervious anagram problem I did, I actaully could solve this! It's my first medium problem I'm attempting to solve too! Even if I don't get it, I'll feel proud for at least knowing where to start solving it.

**What I Learned:**

- It's always a daily battle, you must create good habits that bring you towards your goals. You always gotta ask yourself, is this what am I suppose to be doing right now? Am I moving towards my goals if I finish this? Throughout the day you must consistently ask this to yourself.

### Day 12:

Wednesday, August 3, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Finally finished the [Khan Academy's Divide with remainders](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/x18ca194a:divide-with-remainders) section! I can move on to other maths now! I just gotta keep going everyday.
- Was setuping up ejs-mate with Bootstrap on [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
- Learned that the [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay) is an offset of pacman and can be used to download load AUR packages. I keep running to pacman not being able to download an AUR package, but hopefully once I use yay, I won't have that problem.

**What I Learned:**

- I seriously need to keep asking myself, "what I'm I doing right now moving me towards my goals?" because I keep end up wasting a lot of time just talking with people. My time is better of spent coding more and talking just a little bit.
- I'm starting to realize that coding is mainly a lonely journey. You can't always have a pair programmer going through the same journey with you all the time, not like a party in a rpg game. Maybe I haven't found the right people to work with consistently, but I can't always rely on other people to make my own progress. Just wish I could do more things with people and share knowledge more consistently.

- Switched to the awesome dynamic window manager, just figuring out how to configure everything which is a bit overwhelming.

**What I Learned:**

- Soon or later I will get everything working. I just gotta keep trying.

### Day 15:

Saturday, August 6, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Got up late, but worked on Arch Linux the whole day!
- Worked on getting my ssh working on Arch and oh boy it was an issue for the whole day.

**What I Learned:**

- My wifi driver was freezing so, I had to upgrade my wifi driver to a better one. I only figured this out from hours of trying to figure-out why it was an issue. I had a friend help me for hours trying to get it to work, he was telling my ssh in general was the issue so, he suggested that I try it in the live bootable usb drive. I decided to try in the bootable usb drive and he was right! My Arch install was having some sort of issue and I didn't know what was happening.
- I decided re-install Arch Linux entirely so, I copied all my config files into a usb drive so, I could save them, but it took me awhile to figure-out how to copy it into the usb drive through the terminal, my friend helped me with this. This skill will actually help me later in the process to download package in chroot whiching booting on the bootable usb drive.
- Once I got everything installed, I booted into the installed hard disk and was having wifi issues cause I didn't download them in the install script I was using. I was thinking of reseting the whole script install, but I wanted to see if I could some how download packages while using the bootable usb drive and once I figured out that you can arch-chroot to the disk drive and download packages from there, was I big brain moment for me!
- The linux-header package actually has the b43-firmware-wl as it's dependences if I'm correct so, next time if I do I new install on Arch I'm gonna attempt doing that.

### Day 16:

Sunday, August 7, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Worked on Arch pretty much the whole day, but also talked with people a bunch.
- Got VS Code installed and figured-out why my live share extension in VS Code wasn't working.
- Finally got a Leetcode problem done with a friend. I'm gonna start grinding on it again.

**What I Learned:**

- I first got the VS-Code OSS version which is the open source VS code, but it doesn't even have the live share extension.
- Decided to get the Visual Studio Code .deb download from their actual website, but it was recommended to convert the .deb with debtap to an makepkg so, it could be download as an Arch package.
- I coverted and downloaded it, but it didn't even have the shell path for code so, I couldn't use the code command in the terminal.
- Finally, I got the Arch Visual Studio Code-bin package from the AUR and got the live share extension. Was still running into issues with live share but, I had the extension and I had the code command in the terminal. All I had to do was download icu69 package. This shows what you need in-order for live-share to work on Arch. [live-share-prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/linux#install-linux-prerequisites)

### Day 17:

Monday, August 8, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- I decided to not care about what happen yestorday and just worry about the present day. I was able to do a review on what I need to do in the current day and I think that has helped me to focus better.
- Worked on (create a target array in given order)[https://leetcode.com/problems/create-target-array-in-the-given-order] and beacuse I went over insertion before in the explorer page of Leetcode, I was able figure what to actually do to solve the problem. I have not solved the problem yet, but I'm very close.
- I've been forcing myself to type properly and to learn vim, I think I'm seeing my typing getting faster and I'm getting used to using vim.

**What I Learned:**

- I made some goals and actually full-filled them, why do I need to feel like I've done nothing when I clearly did the things I wrote down? I won't be able to code 247, but if I'm staying consistent, that's all that matters.
- It feels great to be able to finally use my Arch Linux setup after all that work to get it up and running. I still don't have much, but why do I need to wait to starting working my goals? It works right now and I can learn how to do the things I wanna do while using the setup. Why waited and waste time?

### Day 18:

Tueday, August 9, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Finally got (create a target array in given order)[https://leetcode.com/problems/create-target-array-in-the-given-order] done, it felt good to be able to use my past knowledge I learned from data structures and algorithm.
- Got Mongoose setup with a MongoDB atlas cloud server! I'm glad I attempted and it wasn't too diffcult to do.
- A friend helped me setup (AstroVim)[https://astronvim.github.io/], lsp, and eslint to work on my NeoVim, but I'm currently still running into some issues. I'm super glad I tried out eslint cause I didn't really know what it was, it seriously helps with writting code.
- My typing speed is getting faster and I'm also getting used to Vim already. So, glad I went down this route, only issue is that I feel like my arms could have an issue with the way type and support my wrists.

**What I Learned:**

- Being able to do my tasks first before I start chatting with people is a plus so, I can focus on what I'm doing. Putting more time in to projects will help me feel better about my productivity.
- Doing Leetcode problems with people on the other hand will really help my communication skills and problem solving skills because I get to see how other people problem solve. I think it's best to at least do one problem on my own and one with someone so, I can at least finish a problem daily if I'm unable to finish it with them.

### Day 19:

Wednesday, August 10, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- I didn't get much done, but worked on [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/) Leetcode problem. I was able to do this problem in C++! I'm attemping to do the problem in JavaScript and then apply in C++ just to get my feet wet with C++.
- Worked on Khan Academy's arithmetic section, but to much to really say that I got done.

**What I Learned:**

- I seriously gotta be more consistent with what I'm doing.

### Day 20:

Thursday, August 11, 2022

**Todays Progress:**

- Found a cool Neovim plugin called coc which brings LSP for multiple files just like in VS-Code.
- I also helped a friend get VS-Code live share working on Arch Linux, I'm so glad I'm learning and able to help someone with what I've learned.
- Looked into cpu scaling on Arch Linux, but haven't read much on it.

**What I Learned:**

- Keep things rolling, always keep on track.
- I need to finish this neovim things so I can forget out it and work heavily on actually coding.

- Worked on [merged-sort](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3253/) with a friend, didn't get to use the algorithm a learned though.

**What I Learned:**

- Have the urgentence to get things done now! Say out loud "back to work, back to work. I'm highly proudtive person, would a productive person wait?"
- Don't let the past get ahead of you and your future! The past is the past, who cares what happened and don't even think about it.
- Keep track of my goals and stay on top of them. I just gotta finish this course and do things that interests me.

- Watched and solved the [merged-sort](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3253/) soltion. I need to really look at the code and try to understand it better.
- Started to look into Wechat mini-games and got the [Weixin Devtools](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/devtools/devtools.html) on Arch Linux through the AUR.

**What I Learned:**
- I just gotta be more specific on the task I will be doing in the day. I also, gotta listen to motivation things throughout the day, it seriously helps.
