# #100DaysOfCode Log

Today is Saturday, July 23, 2022 @ 11:28 24hrs.

I've decided today that I'm ready to take on this huge challenge! I finally was able to pick myself up mentally after all the burn-out I had with coding.

>
> The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge created by **[Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway) to encourage people to learn new coding skills**. The challenge follows one simple rule: Code for at least an hour each day for 100 consecutive days.

## My Personal Goals:

> - Stay consistent with coding.
> - Make projects on my own from scratch to show to employers.
> - Learn Data Structures and algorithms.
> - Able to do medium level coding problems.

### Day 1:

Saturday, July 23, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- Worked on this Leetcode problem, but couldn't it solve at the time. [Can-place-flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)
- Worked with a friend on [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) [Insurance](https://www.codechef.com/JULY222D/problems/INSURANCE) problem. Was able to solve this one in C++.
- Went over the [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) with a friend and actually started to understand inserting arrays when we attempted to do the algorithm by hand.
- Attempted to use a [zipcodes](https://github.com/davglass/zipcodes) GitHub repo to implement a zipcode search, but I struggling to get TypeScript to work. I never knew how much harder TypeScript could be until this day üòÖ.

**What I Learned:**
- If I'm gonna be doing this for 100 days, I need to keep everything simple and at least just to put 1 hour a day even if I lose sleep üò¢!! Can't let one day miss or it's game over üëæ!

### Day 2:

Sunday, July 24, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- Learned some C++ with a buddy on an amazing website called [replit](https://replit.com/) to code along together!
- Moved all my photos out of my mid 2012 13inch Macbook Pro to a hard-drive. I looked into Arch Linux some more and wanted to download on my Macbook Pro.
- Spent 4 hours on this [coursehero](https://www.coursehero.com/register/) website where I saved the page as a complete webpage so, I could actually see all the code. I had delete so many files and format so many files. A lot of the files are minified so, I had to figure-out what they did, by moving them in a trash folder and seeing what happened. I got it all cleaned up though and it was worth it! I hope to check it out and see what I can learn from it.

**What I Learned:**
- Working with people can really help inspire to do more thing, but also waste some time if you're not careful. Just don't keep talking all day long and not do anything.
- I can actually download the code and clean it up just to see how a website works! I hope to soon rewrite the whole code my own way so, that I know I truly understand it.

### Day 3:

Monday, July 25, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- Was help a friend with solving a Leetcode problem that I already was doing. [duplicate zeros](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3245/)
- Worked on the course hero html and css and I tried to learn from their code.
- Talked to and invited a bunch more people to this coding group I'm in.
-

**What I Learned:**
- I gotta be more satisfied with what I'm doing. I feel overwhelmed with all that I'm doing and don't let myself feel accomplished when finish things.
- Gotta attempt to stay more organized and simpler so, things can run more smoothly so, I don't get so burn-out as much.

### Day 4:

Tueday, July 26, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- Worked on the [course hero login page](https://www.coursehero.com/login/?ref=login) with a friend side by side, but also chatted a bunch about goals and life.
- Listened to the [Develop Yourself](https://open.spotify.com/show/69BHCbRAl6rHT9LlNhFWUy) podcast by Aaron Hayslip & Peter Elbaum. Always cool to hear what other developers have to say.
- I worked on my Arch Linux install on my Macbook Pro and easily got the wifi driver installed so, I could use wifi on it. Took me ages to figure it out before, but because I did it before it was so much easier to do it now.

**What I Learned:**
- I seriously gotta get my goals in check and manage my tasks better. I got really burn-out today from thinking so much and it's not getting me anywhere.
- Some great resources that I want to follow is [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=asc_df_0735211299/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312014159412&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=788027916322023639&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019691&hvtargid=pla-541463258824&psc=1) by James Clear and [Eat That Frog!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6macBFlMWbmpFo4TmtR3MD) by Brian Tracy. These books have so much techniques, insight on finding bad habits, and best ways to optimize yourself to best fit your needs.

### Day 5:

Wednesday, July 27, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- RE-listened to [Eat That Frog!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6macBFlMWbmpFo4TmtR3MD) and actually applied what I learned from it! I did [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) for my very first frog. I choose to do the bootcamp first because I deemed it as the most important task for me to do, my most important frog to eat.
- I did a couple sections on [Khan Academy's divide with remainder](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/x18ca194a:divide-with-remainders) section. I got suck on some of the word problems due to not understanding the problem well or couldn't wrap my head around fractions and division. I'm a little sad, but it will come with practice, I just gotta review it again.
- I attempted to do the [Duplicate number in array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) Leetcode problem, I actually couldn't understand how to process with the problem, but once I checked the related topics section and realized it was part of the sorting problems, I figured out how to solve it. Still sad that I'm struggling with these problems, but I solved it so, who cares.

**What I Learned:**
- Organizing my environment ahead of time will help me be more productive and planning out my week will help with staying on track.
- Finishing my most important task first will really help me stay on task at the start, then I'm more able to procrastinate on my little task cause it's inevitable.

### Day 6:

Thursday, July 28, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- I showed one of my new friends my course-hero clone that I'm doing and let him show me his methods of doing the css. We talked for a while and now I feel more confident with my css skills. The code doesn't have to be perfect, if it works it works. 
- Listened to a book about power and deception.

**What I Learned:**
- If you talk to much, you have more of the odds of saying something foolish than saying less.
- If you keep things vague, people might think of you as smarter and attempting to understand what exactly do you mean.

### Day 7:

Friday, July 29, 2022

**Todays Progress:**
- Worked on [Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) and feel pretty good about routes. Just gotta keep hacking away at it.
- Got bluetooth working with Arch Linux using the bluez and bluetoothctl package. 

**What I Learned:**
- Somedays you won't get much done, but it's better to do something than nothing. 
- I'm exicted and motivated to get better at css! I can't wait to make thing and make it look good. After that, I can work on my backend and DOM skills.
